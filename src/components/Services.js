                        At the moment I use PowerBI to visualize my data and I use the 
                        BI connector to connect PowerBI with my data source MongoDB Atlas. I've 
                        used Azure Data Factory and ETL pipeline to ingest data into a Azure 
                        Data Lake Generation two. I'm currently training for data engineering 
                        certifications, I have plans to learn Machine Learning using frameworks 
                        like Tensorflow 2.0 and I have learning Python and SQL on my list.</p>

                      React building hierarchy stateful components for SPA's. Iâ€™m 
                      proficient in using the state management tool Redux to support 
                      dispatching actions and manage state throughout the entire application. 
                      I'm also comfortable with utilizing Hooks and Context API to support maintaining 
                      the state in React. I can also develop in the backend with NodeJS, ExpressJS and 
                      MongoDB. I always like to keep in consistent communication with product teams, 
                      UX teams, team leads and peers working on the same or different projects.</p>
